## Description
This project is about creating a simplified graphic "wireframe"  
representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z)  
via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in  
a file passed as a parameter to program.

Each number corresponds to a poing in space:
- the horizontal position corresponds to its ordinate
- the vertical position corresponds to its ordinate
- the value corresponds to its altitude

There's been used a graphical library `miniLibX`, that was developed  
internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window,  
light a pixel and deal with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse.
